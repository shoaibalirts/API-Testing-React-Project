# API Testing React Project

<p>HTTP requests</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loading State</li>
    <li>Data State</li>
    <li>Error State</li>
</ul>
<p>Load avilable places </p>
<p>Add those places and store them</p>
<p>Reload to re-fetch those stored places</p>
<p>
<p>Hence, No need to store data locally, everything is going to and from the backend</p>
